Algorithm to Insert Nodes or Edges to Directed Graph

INSERTOperations(String fromNodeName, String toNodeName, String edgeName)

Concrete Data Structure used to store the Graph : Set graphMap:= TreeMap<String fromNodeName, Set<Edge> edges>
		-> Key is NodeA i.e. fromNodeName
		-> Value as set of all edges connecting to NodeA and 
			->Edges contains connectingNode i.e. NodeB and edgeInformation like weight or edge 	name
		->Treemap put the nodes in the natural sort order and we can search the Node in log(n) time.
		->Treemap uses the self balancing Binary tree using the Red  Black	algorithm

Steps of the Algorithm:

1. if graphMap does not contains NodeA then do Step 1.1
		1.1 Put NodeA name to the graphMap as key
2 If NodeB IS NOT NULL or IS NOT BLANK then do
		2.2.1 Create an Edge element containing connecting NodeB name and edgeInfo
		2.2.2 Add edge element to the Set of Edges for the above key i.e. NodeA
